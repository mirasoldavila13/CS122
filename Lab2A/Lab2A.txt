1.The primary key for the Studios table is StudioID.

2.The reason why LastName can't possibly be the primary key is because the primary key needs to be unique.
For an example if they are members that have the identical lastname then that can't uniquely distinguish between them. 

3. The foreign key in the Tracks table that references the title table is TitleID. We know that TitleID is the
foreign key sinces it's being defined in the Tracks table, Although it refers as the primary key that distinguishes 
all the records in the Titles table.


4. The reason why is since  both of the members and artists table doesn't have one primary key that joins them together.
We would need to have three separate tables to match members to artists to combine them as one primary key in the 
XrefArtistsMembers table. By doing that will help the programmer distinguish the specific records they want.


5a.The primary key for the XRefArtistsMembers table is the combination of ArtistID and MemberID.

5b. The relationship between the Artist table and the Members table is unique because they have many relationships.
If you had to compare both the Artist and Titles table where they only have one relationship. 
 

6a. Yes, we can add a new record to the Salespeople table with the following information that was given.


6b. No, we cannot add a new record to the Salespeople table with the following information that was given. The reason is 
that there is a record already stored in the Salespeople table with the sames SalesID.


7. (10 pts) Consider this SQL query:
    SELECT (NULL IS NOT NULL) != (NULL = (NOT NULL));
Why does this query return NULL?  Answer with a simplified proof.

SELECT (NULL IS NOT NULL))     !=     (NULL = (NOT NULL);

NULL                           !=     ( NULL = NULL)

NULL                           !=    NULL

NULL
